The smallest is Italy, with only 4. It is a little bit outlier here, because of difference between USA and other  countries.

Customers.
Analyzing customers I created 3 plots:
Picture:
Customers by country shows that most customers are from USA (6828) And it is more than 3 times higher than the UK (1944) and other countries. It is obvious, because population of USA is much bigger than in other countries.
But if we compare amount of stores and amount of customers in Europe countries. We can see that the biggest number of stores don’t relate to the biggest number of customers. For example the UK has only 7 Brend stores and 1944 customers. Germany has 9 stores and 1473 customers.
Picture:
In this picture we can see that half of customers male and half – female.
Picture:
And of course, average customers age is 57 years.
